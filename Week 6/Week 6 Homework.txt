In my project so far I have not made a ton of changes from what I originally made at the start of the semester. The functionality is still the same but I have just simplified the code. I have made it so the player controlled squares are now a class that I call and the Monte head that is used as the pong ball is also a class. I made it so the monte head spins as it bounces back and forth.

My next goals for my project is to add in simple colliders to make it so the ball will bounce off the squares and then add in the win conditions and points.
